# codenames
## how to play:

1. run util/gameplay.py
2. prompt.png will show
3. pick 1 word from prompt.png and input it to the terminal
4. it will tell you which color it is
5. whichever color team has all of its colored cards picked wins
6. if black card is picked then the team will immediately lose
7. if you happened to pick a card with color the same as your team you get up to 3 consecutive picks
8. if your pick is the other team or neutral then your turn will end
9. every card can only be picked once per round
